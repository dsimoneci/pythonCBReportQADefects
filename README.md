Welcome!

Thank you for taking the time to participate in this QA Defects project. This project is not meant to be THE go/no-go in our decision-making process. Rather, itâ€™s meant as a tool for you to show your way of thinking and a little bit of showing off your Python skills.

Use the following instructions to complete the project.

Sample Code

The Python script provided has several defects that need to be found, reported on and for bonus points remedied. 

For extra, extra bonus points, the Python script provided can be improved in a number of ways. Be creative if you like.

Also included is a sample dataset in SQLite, feel free to use as-is or add more data as needed.

Requirements

Report requirements.  Run the Python script to review the report. All section totals should be correct, all math/calculations should be correct, and the report output data should reflect the input data in the sample database.  Currently the script only creates a local report, it would be nice to have it email (this is one of those updates to show your Python skill).

Testing. Find all defects. Be as fancy-pants as you like on testing, if you want to show automation go for it.  Document the defects and for bonus points fix the Python script. Document how you tested and verified the final Python script is producing an accurate report.

Tools. Feel free to use whatever IDE you like, whatever imports you fancy and basically whatever gets the job done. Perhaps the only constraint is to use trusted sources for any libraries.

Extra-Extra. Extend or rework the script to support:

-More reporting sections without hardcoding each reporting section. The reporting sections should look the same as far as general layout, although the query and number of columns are unique to each section of output.

-Configurable date ranges (you might have to adjust the SQL in sample), we might run the report weekly to see #s for the week, or we might change it up to run daily or even monthly.

-Emailing report. Add to the script to generate and send the output file via email to yourself.


As long as we can get the gist of what you're trying to do, itâ€™s good. This exercise is more about your process, approach and communicating back what you attempted, not to prove you are a seasoned Python professional.
